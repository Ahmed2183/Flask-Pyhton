Command Prompt Commands:

For Creating Virtual Environment Easily: pip install virtualenv
If already installed then no need to install again virtualenv

To see globally all packages: pip list

It's generally a good practice to create a new virtual environment for each new project.

First of all create a new directory for Environments all Environments we create here i create in:
C:\Users\Admin\Enviroments 

Open the command prompt and go on path: C:\Users\Admin\Enviroments

Now Create a new virtual environment:

1. First Time When New Project Is Created:
   Create a new virtual environment for project: virtualenv yourenv_name

   Create a Virtual Environment with a Specific Python Version:
   virtualenv yourenv_name -p C:\Path\To\Python\python.exe


2. If Virtual Environment Created: 
   Activate The Virtual Environment For Your Project In PyCharm: File > Settings > Project: Your ProjectName > 
   Python Interpreter > Add Interpreter >  Add Local Interpreter > Click on Three Dots > 
   Go on path(where virtual environment created) > Select python.exe > ok

3. Deactivate a virtual environment: deactivate

5. Delete Virtual Environment: rmdir /s /q yourenv_name  Or  Simply Delete That Directory/Folder
 
6. Generate requirements.txt:
 
   Locally Generate: pip freeze --local > requirements.txt

   If Virtual Environment is activated and you type pip freeze > requirements.txt then it also generate locally

   Without Activated Virtual Environment You Generate Globally : pip freeze > requirements.txt

7. After Installing New Packages Every Time You Need To Update requirements.txt: 

   If you want to add new packages locally means only in your project requirements.txt: pip freeze --local > requirements.txt  or pip freeze > requirements.txt

   Without Activated Virtual Environment:
   If you want to add new packages globally then:  pip freeze > requirements.txt
     
8. Check Installed Packages: pip list

9. Add requirements.txt In Git Repository
   After Clone Project Install All Dependencies From requirements.txt:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

10.Run Project:
   python run.py

11. Delete All Packages:
    pip uninstall -r requirements.txt -y

    For Globally first deactivate the virtual environment
